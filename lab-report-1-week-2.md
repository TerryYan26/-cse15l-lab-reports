Terminal menu option). Your command will look like this, but with the **zz** replaced by the
letters in your course-specific account.
4. enter the command in your VScode : `$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
5. If you are first time to login, here is the message you will see :
   <br />`$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
<br /> `" The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established."`
<br /> `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?`
6. Type "yes" and enter.
7. Here is the message you will see:

## Moving Files with scp
1. When we want to move file form local computer to remote computer, we have to use command call  <mark>scp </mark>
2. Make sure we are not login the remote compurter.(If we are in the remote computer, use command  <mark>exit </mark>. 
3. Then you will logout it and get the message: `Connection to ieng6<zz>.ucsd.edu closed.`
4. Enter you command in your VScode terminal : `$ scp <file name> cs15lsp22<zz>@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/`
5. Then login your account: `$ ssh cs15lsp22<zz>@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and use  <mark>ls </mark> 
6. You can see your uploading file.
   Here am I using `WhereAMI.java` be the example and you will see the result below:

## Setting an SSH Key
1. Use `$ ssh cs15lsp22<zz>@ieng6.ucsd.edu` login to remote computer.
2. Create  <mark>.ssh </mark> in the remote computer.
3. exit the remote computer.
4. Enter  <mark>ssh-keygen </mark> and some message show below
<br /> `# on client (your computer) `
<br /> `$ ssh-keygen `
<br /> `Generating public/private rsa key pair. `
<br /> `Enter file in which to save the key `
<br /> `(/Users/<user-name>/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/<user-name>/.ssh/id_rsa `
 <br />`Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): `
5. You can use easy passphrase to replace the password or just enter.
6. Then enter again for comfirm and there is the message to show : The key's randomart image is:
<br />`+---[RSA 3072]----+`
<br />`|                 |`
<br />`|   . . + .       |`
<br />`| . . B o .       |`
<br />`| . . B * +..     |`
<br />`| o S = *.B.      |`
<br />`| = = O.*.*+      |`
<br />`| + * *.BE+       |`
<br />`| +.+.o           |`
<br />`|              .. |`
<br />`+----[SHA256]-----+`
7. use `$ scp id_rsa.pub cs15lsp22<zz>@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Then you will auto login to remote computer.

## Optimizing Remote Running
1. Since we have already upload `WhereAmI.java`.
2. `$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, then enter <mark>ls</mark> to list out the file.
3. Enter command`$ javac WhereAmI.java` and `$ java WhereAmI`.
4. Then the java programe is running in the remote computer.
